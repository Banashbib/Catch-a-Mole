# Catch-a-Mole inspired by Mario!
This project will show you how to create a Whac-A-Mole game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on utilizing the HTML5 Canvas API.

Throughout this Mario-themed Whac-A-Mole project, you'll see how to structure the game board by modifying DOM elements, implement click events to whack the mole, and generate moles and piranha plants at random intervals for an interactive experience.
